  Scenario: Verify global navigation menu links are working
    Given the ParaBank application is open
    And the user navigates to the registration page
    And the user registers with the following details
      | PARAM           | VALUE             |
      | firstName       | <generated>       |
      | lastName        | <generated>       |
      | address         | <generated>       |
      | city            | <generated>       |
      | state           | <generated>       |
      | zipCode         | <generated>       |
      | phone           | <generated>       |
      | ssn             | <generated>       |
      | username        | user_<sessionKey> |
      | password        | Test@1234         |
      | confirmPassword | Test@1234         |
    And the registration confirmation is displayed
    Then the global navigation menu should contain the following links
      | linkText            |
      | Open New Account    |
      | Accounts Overview   |
      | Transfer Funds      |
      | Bill Pay            |
      | Find Transactions   |
      | Update Contact Info |
      | Request Loan        |
      | Log Out             |
    And each navigation link should navigate to the correct page
